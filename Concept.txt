Scheduler 


    -> 
        - Allows People To Submit Job
        - When a Job Is Submitted, Returns them a Future, which will eventually contain the result of that job 
        - Queues that job to a queue

    ->
        - A backgroud process that polls the queue periodically. 
        - Once a task is present in the queue, it checks for the available thread.
                - This can be done by maintaining a thread pool, or atomic counter. 

        - If resources are not available it goes in a wait.
